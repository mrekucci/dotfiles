# <BLANK LINE>

# <BLANK LINE>
# <footer>
#
# <type> - mandatory, must be one of the following:
#   - fix:      A bug fix
#   - feat:     A new feature
#   - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#   - test:     Adding missing or correcting existing tests, including refactoring
#   - docs:     Documentation only changes
#   - perf:     A code change that improves performance
#   - style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
#   - chore:    Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
#
# <scope> - optional, could be anything specifying place of the commit change.
# For example when using Golang it's usually a name of the package where changes
# was made. If a change touches two packages, then both can be mentioned as:
# `(package1, package1)`. For more than two packages you can use `*` when the
# change affects more than a single scope.
#
# <subject> - mandatory, contains succinct description of the change:
#   - use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
#   - don't capitalize first letter
#   - no dot (.) at the end
#
# <body> - optional, just as in the <subject>, use the imperative, present
# tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The <body> should include the
# motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
# Limit each line to a maximum of 72 characters.
#
# <footer> - optional, should contain any information about Breaking Changes
# and is also the place to reference GitHub, Jira, etc. issues that this commit
# closes.  Breaking Changes should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with
# a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

# If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`,
# followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say:
# `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being
# reverted.
#
# Example:
#
# feat(http): allow creation of Server manually
#
# The Server struct has exported fields, which allows users to manually
# create a Server object without using NewServer or NewTLSServer and
# directly call Start or StartTLS on their object.
#
# Closes #3366
